Log into Barclays online banking (manually, for now)

Under online statements, you can view your transactions for a given 
quarter.

Under there, you can click "Export All" and choose "Spreadsheet eg. 
Excel", which will download the data as a csv file.

From there, the data can be fed in and processed by this barclays 
module.

IMPORTANT CAVEAT:

Barclays delays taking money from your account for a few days to protect 
against fraud. This is a good thing. However, it means that the dates 
for the payments are consistently a few days late. As such, an 
adjustment is required. I haven't done it yet because I haven't figured 
out the number of days Barclays lags the money for, but if it 
varies inconsistently, that would makes it impossible to use for reasons 
other than checking that you've got everything.
